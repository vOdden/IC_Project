\section{Abstract}
This report describes the design of a four pixel digital camera. It includes analog schematics for the pixels with following digital design for controlling the camera.


\section{Introduction}
% Short description of the project
\textcolor{green}{TODO: Ink√•rt meir utfyllandes i guess} \\
In this project the goal is to design the analog and the digital part of a small four pixel camera. \\

The readout circuit in the analogue design part was provided with some specifications of how the group should design the MOSFETS. The goal of the analouge part is the adjust the transistor sizes to match our expectations and design requirements. \\

In the digital part the goal is to design the controller for the four pixel camera. The finite state machine was written in Verilog in Active-VHDL.
